# MetaInfo Ports 0.0.2

MetaInfo ports is a small package to allow visualizing the ports saved in a cell's LayoutMetaInfos.

After installation a Button with "Show Ports" or "Hide Ports" should appear in the toolbar.

## Installation

To install MetaInfo Ports, open KLayout and open the package manger under `Tools -> Manage Packages`. In the package manager search for `MetaInfo Ports`,
double-click it, check that it has a green check mark on it and press `Apply` on the bottom left. When asked to run the initial script press
`Yes` in order to start klive.

As it's similar to how to install [klive](https://github.com/gdsfactory/klive), the video is the same.
